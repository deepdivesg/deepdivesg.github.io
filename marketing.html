							<h4>Importance of marketing</h4>
							<p>
								Marketing is a strange construct. In recent years, it has taken the place of production as the driving force of revenue. Putting in very crude terms, marketing is a war between the product managers and the customers. The product managers (not the company owners) <i>live and breathe</i> the impression that the product their team is developing is worth the effort, time and dedication, hence, it is only natural for them to want it to be a commercial success. The marketeers on the other hand are the generals. They <i>strategise</i> every move, and send the warriors (sales) out of the fortress to fight the battles. They understand the true nature of the customers.
							</p>
							<p>
								With the advent of capitalism, an open market and the internet, the landscape of marketing has drastically changed. Ample products in every category have flooded the market and the quality expectations of the customers have sky rocketed. Marketing is more important than ever. Customers can use a music streaming service one day and switch to another the next day without any major consequences; but for a product team it can get very tough very fast. Hence we need to provide the generals a well equiped army, provide them the intelligence to develop the best strategies. We at deepdive intend just to do that.
							</p>
							<h4>AI for audience insight</h4>
							<p>
								Marketing strategies are executed in the form of campaigns. Every campaign has an intended audience and an intended outcome (in the form of KPI goals). This is a highly emperical methodology and success of the campaigns are governed by heuristics. AI is essentially a way to optimise heuristics in your favour. Most commonly used AI algorithms and techniques such as machine learning, multivariate optimisations, multimodal learning, reinforcement learning, etc. all are governed by the primal need to draw a decision boundary between two (or more) groups of data with highest probability. Returning back to marketing campaigns, any process or tool which increases the probability of achieving the intended outcome (or meeting the KPI goals) is of high value. This in turn translates to either:.
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Choosing the best target audience for the creatives (Audience insights) <i>or</i></strong></li>
									<li><strong>choosing the best creatives for a target audience (Creative analytics)</strong></li>
								</ul>
								Some examples of how AI can help in carrying out both these tasks is shown below:
